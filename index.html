						<p class="fl">Our goal for the <a href="#">first issue of Walls Down</a> was to introduce a new perspective into our health care conversations. We demonstrated that no separation exists between essential hospitals and our communities, that we are all connected – inside the hospital and out. And we brought this to life by sharing the stories of people who live that connection every day. </p>
						<p>We focused specifically on people who are connected to essential hospitals’ specialized, lifesaving services: trauma care, neonatal intensive care, and disaster response.  </p>
						<p>With this second edition, we turn to another aspect of essential hospitals: the comprehensive, coordinated care they provide to the most vulnerable among us – the disabled, the home-bound, the chronically ill. </p>
						<p>There are many aspects to this topic, many things to say. One of the issues we placed at the forefront of this conversation is how health care coverage and payment influence the care people receive. This is particularly important in the context of our country’s current evolution in health care delivery and payment. And, July 30 is the 50th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid – our country’s largest and perhaps most complex health care payers.</p>
						<p>Medicare and Medicaid have often been on the leading edge of change in health care. The fact is, in our country, insurance coverage can largely determine a person’s health care options. So policymakers regularly amend the laws and regulations governing these public payers to respond to our changing health care needs. In doing so, these programs have catalyzed change in the way care is delivered throughout our system, sparking quality improvement. </p>
						<p>Medicare and Medicaid pay for roughly half of the inpatient and outpatient care at essential hospitals. The staff at these hospitals have been able to improve their patients’ lives by using the inherent flexibility and innovation these programs provide. </p>
						<p>In this issue, you will meet people who have been down, but are now hopeful. You will also meet the people who care for them. And you will meet the payers that are intricately intertwined in their stories.</p>
